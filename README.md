## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
I.
Agile is more beneficial if: Project size and complexity is small or not complex (can be used on larger projects under certain circumstances) e.g. smaller eCommerce, websites, app development.
While water fall is beneficial if: Project size and complexity is large, e.g. large system integration involving many different systems.
II.
Agile is more beneficial if:  The customer is available frequently through the duration of the project.
Waterfall is beneficial if:  The customer cannot commit to extensive involvement.
III.
Agile is beneficial if:  External system integration is simple or not needed.

Waterfall is beneficial if: External system integrations are numerous involving many points (incl. legacy systems).

IV.
Agile is beneficial if: Budget and/or schedule are flexible and changes are welcomed by the customer.
Waterfall is beneficial if: Budget and/or schedule are fixed or difficult to modify.

V.
Agile is beneficial if: The product is intended for an industry with constantly changing standards.
Waterfall is beneficial if: The customer does not expect major changes in the scope and knows exactly what they want.

Examples
Agile Example: A startup developing a new mobile app where user needs are still being discovered, and rapid iterations based on feedback are crucial for success
Waterfall Example: A government contract for developing a compliance-driven system where all requirements must be documented and approved upfront with minimal changes expected.
